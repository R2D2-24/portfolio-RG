      <p id="intro">
        Hello! I'm Rishav Goswami. I am 18 (soon to be 19) years old. I live in Ghaziabad, UP. I am currently doing my B.Tech degree from a reputed engineering college <a href="https://www.nsit.ac.in" target="_blank">Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT)</a>, Delhi. I'm in my second year of engineering from branch Manufacturing Processes and Automation (MPAE). This is a short description about me and my life till now.

    <h3 id="education">Education</h3>
      <p id="edu">
        As I mentioned, I'm doing my B.Tech from NSUT in MPAE branch (2025 batch). I completed my secondary education i.e. 10th class from <a href="https://www.gurukultheschool.com" target="_blank">Gurukul The School</a>, Ghaziabad. I scored 97.5% in the 10th Board Examinations. <br> I completed my senior secondary education i.e. 12th class from Deen Bandhu Public School. We didn't have physical board examinations due to the coronavirus outbreak. I got 87% (sigh) in the board exams which weren't held.

      <p id="ski">
        As far as skills go, I'm still trying to accquire some of them. As a matter of fact, this webpage is my first ever project in my Web Development learning. I started to learn Web Dev (mostly HTML) few days ago from scratch. I hope the people at IOSD like it :) <br> I have some grasp over Python language. I learnt Python from scratch after my JEE Adv exam last August. Python was my first language in the world of coding. I learnt it till OOPS concept. <br> Apart from Python, I have some basic understanding of C language. I'm trying to
       learn it to start the DSA part quickly. <br> Apart from all these, I want to learn basic level of video editing. It may come in handy later. Content Writing is also one more thing which I am interested in.

        I don't really think I've really achieved anything worth mentioning in my life yet. So stay tuned for future updates to this page :)

      <p id="sport">
        Aha! My favorite section. Finally something in which I cannot pretend much. <br> I have a lot of hobbies. Most of my time goes in these hobbies only. I love playing. I usually like playing any game or sport. Cricket and Table Tennis are my favorite outdoor sports. I used to play a lot of outdoor cricket before the pandemic. It stopped during and after the gap of 2+ years. I'm still trying to continue playing Table Tennis though. I've won few inter-society awards in the same too.  <br> During the pandemic, I started learning and playing Chess and I've simply started loving the game. I went from a complete newbie one year back to a decent intermediate player now. <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/skywalker200" target="_blank">Link to my chess.com account.</a> Hey, I even got selected in the NSUT Shatranj team. I guess I could call that an achievement and add it to the section above lol.

        I also love reading novels and watching movies. In novels, I love murder mysteries and thrillers. My favorite author is undoubtedly Agatha Christie and my favotite book is And Then There Were None by the same. It's a must read. In lockdown, I read a lot of books and also watched a ton of movies and TV shows. I love watching thrillers and sci-fi a lot. My favorite movies include Dune, Knives Out, Interstellar and The Shawshank Redemption. I know it's a weird mix, but these are all so great movies.
